# CITATIONS

This document provides conceptual anchors, research bridges, foundational references, and academic research that guide the Context-Engineering repository. These references support our approach to context as a continuous field with emergent properties, symbolic mechanisms, and cognitive tools.

## Core Conceptual Anchors

### 1. SuperSol Layer 2 Architecture and Tokenomics Framework
**Source:** SomeRandmGuyy. (2025). *SuperSol Documentation: Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Solana*. GitHub Repository. https://github.com/SomeRandmGuyy/SuperSol-docs

**Key Concepts:**
- **Layer 2 Scaling Architecture**: SuperSol implements a comprehensive Layer 2 solution for Solana with modular components including core protocols, data availability layers, and peer-to-peer networking
- **Tokenomics Integration**: The framework incorporates economic incentives and token utility mechanisms within the scaling solution
- **Distributed Systems Design**: Implements peer-to-peer networking protocols for node communication and synchronization
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Defines core logic and consensus rules for Layer 2 interoperability with Solana

**Connections to Context-Engineering:**
- Provides practical implementation framework for tokenomics research in Layer 2 contexts
- Demonstrates real-world application of distributed consensus mechanisms
- Offers modular architecture patterns applicable to context engineering systems
- Validates approaches to scaling blockchain contexts through Layer 2 solutions

**Socratic Questions:**
- How can Layer 2 scaling mechanisms be applied to context engineering architectures?
- What tokenomics principles from SuperSol could inform context-based incentive systems?
- How do distributed consensus mechanisms relate to emergent context properties?
- Can modular Layer 2 design patterns be adapted for context processing systems?

### 2. Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms in LLMs
**Source:** Yang, Y., Campbell, D., Huang, K., Wang, M., Cohen, J., & Webb, T. (2025). "Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models." *Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning*.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Three-Stage Symbolic Architecture**: LLMs implement reasoning through an emergent three-stage process:
  - **Symbol Abstraction**: Heads in early layers convert input tokens to abstract variables based on relations between tokens
  - **Symbolic Induction**: Heads in intermediate layers perform sequence induction over abstract variables
  - **Retrieval**: Heads in later layers predict next tokens by retrieving values associated with predicted abstract variables

**Connections to Context-Engineering:**
- Directly supports our `08_neural_fields_foundations.md` and `12_symbolic_mechanisms.md` foundations
- Provides mechanistic understanding for `30_examples/09_emergence_lab/` implementations
- Validates our approach to treating context as continuous fields with emergent properties

**Socratic Questions:**
- How can we design context structures that explicitly leverage these three stages?
- Can we create tools to detect and measure the emergence of symbolic processing?
- How might we enhance retrieval mechanisms through better field-based context design?

### 3. EXPchain: Scaling Trust in AI through Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning
**Source:** Polyhedra Network. (2024). *EXPchain Litepaper: Scaling Trust in the Age of Artificial Intelligence*. Polyhedra Network Documentation. https://docs.polyhedra.network/litepaper/

**Key Concepts:**

- **Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Framework**: Novel consensus mechanism for verifiable AI applications
- **Expander Proof System**: High-performance zero-knowledge prover optimized for AI verification
- **zkPyTorch Toolkit**: Developer-friendly integration of zkML into traditional AI workflows
- **AI-Blockchain Convergence**: Addresses the $15.7 trillion AI market and $3.1 trillion blockchain market intersection

**Connections to Context-Engineering:**
